<p>Raspberry Pi 2 comes armed with the 900 MHz quad-core ARM Cortex-A7 and 1 GB of memory. This is a pretty powerful hardware considering the hobbyist Internet Of Things applications, but it's still relatively slow comparing to the industrial-grade microcomputers. As soon as my very own Raspberry Pi 2 has been shipped to me, I started to wonder how fast this car key size computer can be.</p>
