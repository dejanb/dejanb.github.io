<p>This demo will be divided into 2 parts, first is to setup the Messaging broker on OpenShift with MQTT Connector. Then we are going to write a simple demo trying to connect to the broker via MQTT. Openshift is the open and unified Platform-as-a-Service (PaaS) offering for enterprises from Red Hat. So developers like me don't have to go through all the hassle about setting up the environments or managing the networks.</p>
